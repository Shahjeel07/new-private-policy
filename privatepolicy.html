    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Effective date: September 20, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>Neo Calculator</strong> (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles information and protects your privacy. Neo Calculator is a simple calculator application that helps users perform basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — and it includes advertisements to support the app.</p>

    <h2>App details</h2>
    <p><strong>App name:</strong> Neo Calculator<br>
    <strong>Primary function:</strong> Perform arithmetic calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).<br>
    <strong>Advertising:</strong> The App displays advertisements provided by third-party ad networks.</p>

    <h2>Information the App collects</h2>
    <p><strong>Short answer:</strong> The App itself does not collect or store any personal information about you.</p>
    <p>Neo Calculator is designed as a simple, local-use utility. It does not require account creation, sign-in, or any personal details to function. The App does not collect your name, email address, phone number, or any personally identifiable information (PII) within the App.</p>

    <h2>About advertisements and third-party services</h2>
    <p>The App displays ads from third-party advertising networks. These third parties may independently collect or process information to deliver and measure ads (for example, advertising identifiers, device information, or usage signals). This Privacy Policy does not govern those third parties — their practices are subject to their own privacy policies.</p>
    <p>If you wish to know what data a particular ad network collects or how it is used, please consult the privacy policy of that ad provider. Common ad-related activities may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Serving personalized or non-personalized ads</li>
      <li>Collecting device or app usage information (for ad performance and fraud prevention)</li>
      <li>Using identifiers (such as advertising IDs) for ad targeting or frequency capping</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Analytics and crash reporting</h2>
    <p>The App does not include any analytics or crash-reporting services by default. If analytics or crash-reporting libraries are added in future releases, those services and their data practices will be documented here and in the app update notes.</p>

    <h2>Data storage and retention</h2>
    <p>Because the App does not collect personal data, there is no personal data retained by the App. Calculation inputs and history (if a local history feature exists) are stored only on the user's device and are not transmitted to servers.</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>The App is a general-purpose calculator and is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. Because the App does not collect personal information, it does not knowingly collect or retain information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information to the App, please contact us (see <em>Contact</em> below).</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect any local data stored by the App on your device. However, no method of electronic storage or transmission is completely secure. The App does not transmit or store personal data on servers under our control.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes (for example, if we start collecting personal data or add analytics), we will update the "Effective date" above and, where appropriate, provide notice through the App's update notes or in-app messaging.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <strong>support@yourdomain.com</strong>. Replace this address with your official support email before publishing.</p>
